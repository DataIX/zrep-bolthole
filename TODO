I still need to add in:

  -P flag to "sync all", to autouse parallelism
  	(make it timestamp limited)
	Need to also make debug output parallel-friendly

  Add in optional /etc/zreprc to save time doing autodetect?
   

BLOCKED on these changes:
  Figure out way to convert zfs "creation" value to simple number, for
    timestamp comparisons?

  status subcommand should estimate how much data needs syncing
  BLOCK: can't find way to calculate this?
   (Another problem is in dealing with loong fs names?

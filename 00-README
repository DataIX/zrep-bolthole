If you came here looking for the "source" of zrep, only because you want to 
"compile" it to use it... dont bother! just great latest official release from

http://www.bolthole.com/solaris/zrep

It's a script; you dont actually need to "compile" it, to use it.
This directory is just for people who are curious how I develop and maintain it

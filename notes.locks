Notes on how "normal" thing does locks n stuff.


zrep sync:

	* lock src fs
	* (retry if appropriate)
	* call _snapandsync
	* call _expire
	* unlock src fs
	end


_snapandsync
	*(create snapshot...)

	_sync

_sync
	* find last sent
	* find newest snap
	* put together the zfs incremental command
	* Attempt to set zrep:sent=xxxx   on snapshot, on REMOTE side,
	   and then local
	   - If this fails, set zrep:lastsent and lastsenttime, on *filesystem*
	      of remote side, and then local
